This project is currently creating a mesh from signed distance fields. The resulting mesh has UVs set from primitive based uv maps applied to that mesh. I would like to also add support for projection texture mapping, but for that to work, the mesh needs to have its UVs repacked into a single atlas.

The attached document is a design for a cuda based UV packer. Please read and grok, if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to ask for as much clarification as you need, otherwise proceed.

When complete, it should be hooked up to "A" keypress to run and apply the packing, then be ready for projection mapping tests.
