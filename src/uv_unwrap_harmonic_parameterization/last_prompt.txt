Currently there is a uv unwrap Algorithm implemented here, see the @README.md , based on the UV Atlas unwrap plan document also include. When adding support for texture projection baking, it was obvious that some clusters did not get acceptable results for UV coords, see the HARMONIC_PARAMETERIZATION_ISSUES document, that document is the result of the first attempt to fix the issues, this will be the second attempt. There is also some feedback from chat gpts to offer some direction. grok all these documents and make a second attempt to fix this UV unwrapping code. If you have questions of concerns, feel free to ask for clarification before proceeding, otherwise continue.
