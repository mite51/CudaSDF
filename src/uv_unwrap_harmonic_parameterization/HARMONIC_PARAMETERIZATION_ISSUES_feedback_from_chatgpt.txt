Best direction: switch the parameterization step to LSCM

This is exactly what your doc recommends, and I agree with that recommendation. LSCM removes the most brittle piece of your current approach: forcing a circular boundary, which is a huge conditioning problem when the 3D boundary is irregular/nonconvex (common in concave areas). 

LSCM is also less sensitive to obtuse triangles/cotan nastiness because it’s not “solve Δu=0 with tricky weights under hard boundary constraints” — it’s a least-squares conformal objective with only a couple of pins. 
Concretely, what to do next (minimal disruption)

Keep your charting/merging fixes. You already solved mass chart degeneracy by force-merging tiny charts (649 → 126). That’s the right move. 

Replace SolveHarmonic() with SolveLSCM() as the primary path. Keep harmonic only as a fallback if you want. Your doc even sketches the integration pattern and config enum. 

Pin two vertices per chart (farthest-apart is a good heuristic) and solve the LSCM normal equations (or direct least squares). The doc outlines this and why it’s stable. 

Add a hard validation step after parameterization:

count zero-area & inverted UV triangles per chart

if above a small threshold, split the chart (or retry with different pins), don’t just planar-fallback the whole thing
